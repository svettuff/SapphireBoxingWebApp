## "Postman" Combination

Let’s break down the popular and effective combination known as the **"Postman"**. This combination consists of three precise straight punches: two left jabs and one right straight. Each punch is distinct and delivered with accuracy and intent.

Why is this combination called "Postman"? Because it resembles the process of a postman knocking on a door: first two knocks with the left hand, then, when the door opens, the third punch with the right hand—right into the open door, i.e., the opponent.

### Execution Technique

1. **Double Jab:**

- The first jab is executed quickly but not with full force. The purpose of this punch is to test the opponent's defense, divert their attention, or force them to retreat. It helps create distance or "open up" the opponent's guard for the next punch.

- The second jab follows immediately after the first, potentially more focused and aimed at keeping the opponent in place or setting them up for the main punch—the right straight. This punch is often used as preparatory for the right straight.

2. **Right Straight:** Once the second jab distracts or destabilizes the opponent, a strong punch with the right hand follows. This is the primary power strike in the combination, intended to inflict significant damage.

### Training Tips

The "Postman" combination should be practiced until it becomes second nature, allowing you to execute it without hesitation. Try varying the punches, for example: two jabs to the body and one to the head, or two jabs to the body followed by a right straight to the head. This adds unpredictability to your attack, preventing the opponent from adapting to your combination and increasing your chances of successfully landing the punches.
