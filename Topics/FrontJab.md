## Front Hand Jab

From my personal experience, the front hand jab constitutes 75% of the work done during a fight. The front hand constantly looms over the opponent, not letting them relax for a second. This exhausts the opponent and forces them to focus on your front hand, which conceals the right hand, ready for the next strike.

### Execution Technique

1. **Hand Movement:** The punch starts from the shoulder, with the arm thrust sharply forward, moving straight ahead while the wrist turns so that the fist is horizontal at the moment of impact. The elbow stays close to the body to avoid opening up the defense.

2. **Footwork and Torso Movement:** To strengthen the punch, the boxer may slightly shift their weight from the back foot to the front foot, moving the torso slightly forward and taking a small step with the front foot. This adds momentum to the punch and helps maintain balance.

3. **Quick Return:** After the punch, the arm quickly returns to its initial position to guard the face.

The key emphases of the Soviet school are the clarity and speed of the punch, controlling distance, and maintaining balance and defense. Many make the mistake of not fully rotating their torso and wrist during the punch, resulting in a short and less impactful strike.

Learn to execute this punch correctly to hit your opponent with jabs as sharp as a bayonet.
