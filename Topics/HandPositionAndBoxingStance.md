## Hand Position and Boxing Stance

In the Soviet school of boxing, great attention was paid to proper stance and hand positioning, ensuring stable defense and readiness to attack.

### Boxing Stance

When considering the boxing stance as a whole, it should be completely mobile and resemble the shape of a water vessel. Wherever the punch is directed, the torso moves in that direction—it’s all one movement, with nothing remaining static when shifting back, forward, or to the sides.

1. **Feet:** Shoulder-width apart, the front foot slightly ahead (if you are right-handed, the left foot is in front). Both knees are slightly bent, and weight is evenly distributed.

2. **Torso:** Slightly leaning forward, with relaxed shoulders.

3. **Head:** Chin tucked into the chest, eyes focused on the opponent.

### Hand Position

1. **Front Hand** (left for right-handers): The elbow shields the torso, the fist is at shoulder level, and slightly extended forward. This hand is used for jabs and defense.

2. **Back Hand** (right for right-handers): Positioned closer to the chin, protecting the jaw and ready for powerful punches.

In this stance, the boxer is always prepared for defense and attack while effectively protecting the head and torso, staying mobile and not tense.
