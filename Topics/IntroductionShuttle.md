## Introduction

Welcome to my online course on the Soviet style of boxing. The goal of this project is to teach everyone the basics of boxing techniques, share interesting moves proven in real fights, and help you gain self-confidence and learn to stand up for yourself.

The course begins with the simplest techniques, and as you progress, you will master increasingly complex combinations and movements. I have tried to make the program accessible to all levels—from beginners to those already familiar with boxing. All information and training are supplemented with videos demonstrating the correct execution of these movements or combinations, so any mistakes can be easily identified.

Get ready for training and aim for new heights in boxing. Wishing you productive workouts!

### The "Shuttle"

No first training session is complete without learning a basic technique. Let’s start with the boxing stance, which in the Soviet school of boxing is called the **“shuttle.”**

In boxing, the shuttle is a light and quick forward-and-backward movement performed on slightly bent legs. It helps the boxer stay mobile, maintain balance, and react quickly to the opponent’s actions.

### Execution Technique

1. **Position your feet shoulder-width apart,** with one foot slightly ahead (whichever feels most comfortable).

2. **Gently shift your weight** from one foot to the other, moving forward and backward.

3. When moving forward, **the front foot steps forward,** and **the back foot follows.** When moving backward, do the opposite.

4. **Important:** Always stay on slightly bent legs and move lightly, without jumping, to remain ready for attack or defense.

The shuttle allows you to adjust your distance from the opponent and avoid punches while staying active and ready to counterattack.
