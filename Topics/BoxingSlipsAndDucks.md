## Boxing Slips and Ducks

### Side Slips

One of the most effective defensive techniques in boxing, widely used in the Soviet school. This technique not only helps to avoid the opponent's punches but also creates advantageous positions for counterattacks.

### Body Movement

A side slip is performed by moving the upper body to the side. The torso tilts to the left or right depending on the direction of the opponent's attack. It's important that the slip is achieved not only by tilting but also by shifting the hips and shoulders, which helps maintain balance and mobility.

- **Footwork:** It’s crucial that the feet always remain in the correct position. The body weight shifts from one foot to the other, but the boxer maintains their stance, allowing for quick recovery after the slip and readiness for the next move—either an attack or additional defense.

- **Coordination and Balance:** Side slips require perfect control over balance. It’s essential to avoid excessive leaning forward or backward during the movement, which can lead to injuries or an overly open stance.

I recommend performing this exercise with a small weight to strengthen the lateral back and abdominal muscles. This will make you feel more comfortable when performing the movement.

### Ducks Against Hooks

Ducks are used by boxers at medium or close range when the opponent might throw hooks. The technique is as follows:

- **Squatting and Slipping:** A duck is performed through a slight squat combined with a downward and sideways movement of the torso under the punch. This helps to avoid a head strike while maintaining a defensive position.

- **Footwork:** During the duck, one foot slightly shifts forward, ensuring smooth body movement and balance. The boxer must remain stable for a quick counterattack.

- **Circular Body Movement:** The torso moves in an arc—down and to the side—to evade the punch. This minimizes risk and allows for an immediate return to the starting position for an attack. It’s very important during this movement to always keep your opponent in sight and avoid bending the back into an arch to prevent injuries or unexpected frontal punches.

These two movements are practiced during warm-ups, pair work, or on pads. It’s best to stand in front of a mirror to observe yourself and correct your mistakes.
