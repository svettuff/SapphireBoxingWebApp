## "Pullback, Right Straight" Combination

Let’s analyze a combination widely used in both the Soviet and American boxing schools. This technique allows you to close in on the opponent at short range, wait for them to attempt a punch, and use their miss for a counterattack.

### Execution Technique

1. **Preparation for the Punch:** During the pullback, the boxer maintains balance, preparing the right hand for the counterpunch. The left shoulder is slightly lowered, while the right shoulder is poised to move. It’s important to maintain equilibrium and stay mobile to react quickly.

2. **Pullback:** When the opponent begins their attack, you slightly crouch, shift your weight to the back foot, and tilt your torso backward. This causes the opponent to miss, leaving you in an excellent position for a counterattack. It’s essential that the pullback is smooth and doesn’t leave you vulnerable to follow-up attacks.

3. **Punch:** After the pullback, quickly return your torso to the starting position and simultaneously throw the right hand. The energy for the punch comes from the right leg, which generates impulse and transfers it through the torso to the fist. The elbow should stay aligned with the punch, and the shoulder should shield the chin to minimize vulnerability.

4. **Finish:** After the punch, the boxer returns to the initial stance, ready for the next move or defense.

This combination is best practiced in front of a mirror, on boxing pads, or a heavy bag. It’s important to train this combination at high speed to ensure you can promptly return to your stance and avoid remaining on the back foot, which could make your torso vulnerable to potential attacks.
