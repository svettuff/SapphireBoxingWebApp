## "Cross" Combination

The "Cross" combination is executed at close range and is ideal for situations where you have already closed in on your opponent after "finding" their position. The essence of this combination is four powerful, explosive hooks aimed at different parts of the opponent's body.

### Execution Technique

1. **First Punch — Right Hook to the Head:** This punch initiates the combination and breaks through the opponent's defense. It must be strong and precise enough to force them to retreat or at least disrupt their rhythm.

2. **Second Punch — Left Hook to the Head:** This continues from the first punch. The left hook should be even more powerful, making the opponent feel the hit and change their position.

3. **Third Punch — Right Hook to the Body:** Immediately after the head punch, deliver a right hook to the body, aiming at the opponent’s liver. This punch aims to throw them off balance and cause pain, weakening their defense.

4. **Fourth Punch — Left Hook to the Body:** The final punch in the combination is a left hook to the body, which should be powerful and emphasized. This final hit applies significant pressure on the opponent and can lead to decisive weakening or even a knockout.

### Training Recommendations

The best way to train this combination is on the bag, closing in for a clinch and practicing the speed and power of the punches. It’s important not only to work on the power of the punches but also to ensure their precision and technique so that each punch lands effectively.
