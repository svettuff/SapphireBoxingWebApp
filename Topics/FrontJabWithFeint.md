## Jab with Feint

Now that you have mastered the technique of the classic jab, it’s time to learn a crafty move that will help you effectively hit your opponent in the most unexpected situations. This variation of the punch includes a feint that creates a pause before striking, confusing the opponent.

### Execution Technique

1. **Feint:** The feint resembles a regular jab but with a barely noticeable pause. While moving in the boxer’s shuffle (basic footwork), when the weight shifts to the front foot, you make a small pause. As soon as it ends, deliver the punch.

2. **Punch:** After the pause, complete the jab, maintaining precision and speed.

This pause, though brief, plays a critical role. It momentarily "disables" the opponent’s focus, misleading them. Our brain instinctively tries to predict the opponent’s actions, and at the moment when it seems you are about to punch but slow down, the opponent’s reaction is tricked. As a result, when the jab does follow, it is much more likely to land, as the opponent either freezes in confusion or reacts too late.

### Key Points

1. Do not overuse this feint. Use it 1-2 times per round to prevent the opponent from adapting to the same tactic. Otherwise, they will start reading your movements and counterattacking.

2. Vary the rhythm. Alternating between regular jabs and jabs with a feint will make your actions unpredictable, significantly complicating things for the opponent.

Thus, this technique becomes your hidden weapon—unexpected and precise.
