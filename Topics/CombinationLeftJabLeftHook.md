## "Left Jab, Left Hook" Combination

This combination has many variations. It can be performed while advancing, stationary, or retreating. The most effective version is executing the combination while retreating. You essentially provoke the opponent with a left jab, step back, and at the same moment deliver a left hook, striking the opponent from the front and the side.

### Execution Technique

1. **Left Jab:** The punch is thrown with the lead (left) hand, quickly and sharply. Simultaneously, a small step forward with the left foot is made to close the distance. The shoulder protects the chin, while the right hand stays near the head for defense.

2. **Retreat:** After delivering the jab, the boxer steps back or diagonally backward with a simultaneous tilt of the torso to evade a potential counterattack.

3. **Left Hook While Retreating:** As the opponent moves in, a left hook is delivered while retreating. It is thrown from the same position but with a torso twist to the left and a weight shift to the right foot. The arm punches in an arc, and the torso slightly leans back, allowing you to avoid direct contact and maintain balance.

This combination is best practiced on boxing pads, where the coach changes distance, advancing toward you after your initial jab.
